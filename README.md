# password-generator-aa

## The purpose of this project is to make a password generator. The user will click the generate password buton and will be prompted to select a number of characters from 8-128. Once the user selects the number of characters they will be asked to select yes or no to the following questions: Do you want lowercase characters included in the password?, Do you want upperrcase characters included in the password?, Do you want numeric characters included in the password?, Do you want special characters included in the password?. Once the user makes their choices, the password will be rendered in the text box. If the user doesn't select the the proper amount of characters for the password or if they do not select at least one of the character types for the password they will see a message in the textbox alerting them of the error. 

## Technologies Used: html, css, and java script
